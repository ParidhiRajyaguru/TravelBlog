            <h4>Old City Walls</h4>
            <h6 class="location" >Dübrovnik, Croatia</h6>
            <p>The first thing you'll see as you approach Dubrovnik from the sky or the sea is the city walls. These ancient fortifications were built and rebuilt in the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries as the threat of Turkish invaders grew. At some points, the walls are almost 20 feet thick and 82 feet high. They enclose the entire Old Town, protected by strategically placed forts and towers.</p>
            <p>Since the eminent threat of invaders has dissipated, the walls have become a tourist favorite. Atop the city walls, you'll enjoy some of the best views of Dubrovnik's tiled-roof buildings and the blue sea. During the Summer Festival, Shakespeare plays and other performances take place in some of the forts along the wall.
            </p>
            <p>With their imposing watchtowers looming over the medieval city and dramatic fortifications edging the sea cliffs, Dubrovnik’s ancient city walls are an impressive sight and deserving of their star-attraction status.</p>

            <h4>Akrópolis</h4>
            <h6 class="location">Athens, Attica, Greece</h6>
            <p>The Acropolis of Athens is rich with history and full of physical reminders of the greatness of the Greek empire. Although there are several buildings and monuments in the Acropolis, the most recognizable is the Parthenon, which was a temple built for the goddess Athena. Other monuments include the Propylaea, the temple of Athena Nike, the Erechtheion and the Odeon of Herodes Atticus. Take a tour with the photo gallery above.</p>
            <p>Built by the architects Ictinus and Callicrates, under the supervision of the sculptor Phidias, the temple is considered as the culmination of the development of the Doric order, the most minimal out of the three classical Greek architectural styles. A pairing of simplicity and power built to extremely precise dimensions, according to mathematical rations of sacred geometry.</p>
            <p>A unique piece of artistic and architectural excellence, and an inspiration for numerous artists from the Roman times till the present, it is one of the most significant UNESCO world heritage sites around the world. </p>

            <h4>Musée du Louvre</h4>
            <h6 class="location">Paris, France</h6>
            <p>A visit to the Louvre and its collections lets visitors discover Western art from the Middle Ages to 1848, as well as a large number of ancient civilizations. Yet it also offers another history to explore. The grand palace that houses the museum, which dates back to the late twelfth century, is a true lesson in architecture: from 1200 to 2011, the most innovative architects have in turn built and developed the Louvre. Long the seat of power, this royal residence was also home to French heads of state until 1870 and is one of the major backdrops to the history of Paris and of France.

            <h4>Moorea Beach Lodge</h4>
            <h6 class="location">Moorea, French Polynesia</h6>
            <p>The "Paradise-Tahiti" has the shape of this lodge on the golden sand of Moorea. The Bay of Opunohu where Captain Cook first arrived is more to the north and is magnificent from the belvedere, inside the valley, the volcano's caldera welcomes the ordered pineapple plantations on beaten earth. But here we are in Haapiti, lapped by the shallow water, that the night withdraws and leaves circles of moon-colored Martian algae. We do not need anything else for a few days.

            <p>You sleep in the face of the ocean, it rests in the shade of some slender palm tree, you live on the long wooden veranda, the water always on the horizon, at breakfast a French-Polynesian brunch endowed with uncommon grace: little fruit salad, any style eggs, warm cream flan with toasted almonds, baguette, grapefruit and pineapple house jam, fresh juice of tropical fruit.
            <p> You read the emails under the magic tree ('arbremagique' is the wifi password) in the central courtyard, a large tree for children's books with lianas and trunk to hug. You go out to swim with whales, stingrays, lemon sharks.</p>
